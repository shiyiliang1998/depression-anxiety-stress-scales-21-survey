# Experiment Factory Survey

Hi Friend! This is an Experiment Survey that is friendly for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory). You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions. This survey was generated from the [config.json](config.json) and [survey.tsv](survey.tsv) file using the [survey generaetor](https://github.com/expfactory/survey-generator):

```bash
$ docker run -v $PWD:/data expfactory/survey-generator start
```
